# Why I Matter Legacy :classical_building:

Because I grew up with it.

## Beginning of My Journey

### Why I started programming :national_park:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning was quite simple. Everything in our universe began from a simple thing or a thought. So as mine. I was a 12-years-old boy, and I wanted to be a hacker &mdash;not the serious one, but only to prank my friends playfully like other hackers used to back then in the 90s-00s.&mdash; Same as the other boys of the same age, I just wanted to do something special that no one could do. That's why I started programming.

### How I started :book:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad was also a system engineer and was understanding of programming. So I asked my dad I want to do programming &mdash;I didn't say 'hacking,' obviously,&mdash; and a few days later, he bought me a book titled "C language, beginning from 14, exciting game programming class (14歳からはじめるC言語オンラインゲームプログラミング教室 - 大槻 有一郎)." He couldn't find the book for under 14, because back then in Japan, programming skills were not considered as important as they are today.
