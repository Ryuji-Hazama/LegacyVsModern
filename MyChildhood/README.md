# Why I Matter Legacy :classical_building:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I grew up with it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as just a theory, but as a practice&mdash;with tools long gone, and code long hidden. Yet both are still alive&mdash;in my blood, and beneath the modern code.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me guide you on a journey into the "Legacy"... through my childhood.

## Beginning of My Journey

### Why I started programming :national_park:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning was quite simple. Everything in our universe began from a simple thing or a thought. So as mine. I was a *12-years-old boy*, and I wanted to be a **hacker** &mdash;not the serious one, but only to prank my friends playfully like other hackers used to back then in the 90s-00s.&mdash; Same as the other boys of the same age, I just wanted to do *something special* that **no one could do**. That's why I started programming.

### How I started :book:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad was also a system engineer and was understanding of programming. So I asked my dad *I want to do programming* &mdash;I didn't say 'hacking,' obviously,&mdash; and a few days later, he bought me **a book** titled "*C language, beginning from 14, exciting game programming class* (14歳からはじめるC言語オンラインゲームプログラミング教室 - 大槻 有一郎)." &mdash;He couldn't find the book for under 14, because back then in Japan, programming skills were not considered as important as they are today.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the book contained the installation media for *BCC Developer* and *Borland C++ compiler* as an appendix. That was the starting point for *over 20 years of my programming journey*.

## "Play" with Programming :game_die:

### Computer was my toy :video_game:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I've been using computers* since I can remember. Mostly, I played games with it. But after I've learned programming, it changed the computer more than just a gaming machine. I was able to control the computer at the system level as the *ruler of the machine*, and breaking it or making it better **all depended on me**. That made me attracted to the computer more than the other game machines or any other toys.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending hours in front of the computer, coding with it after school, and debugging on weekends. That's how I spent my time in my teenage years. **The computer was a toy**, and the *coding was a video game* for me that explored IT world.

### How did I learn :cd:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, learning programming in the early 2000s was not as easy as it is today. There wasn't much information on the internet, and no AI I could ask for help. I also had almost no one around me to ask. I could ask my dad, but programming was not considered important in Japan at that time, so most people simply weren't interested or didn't know anything about it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just "survived" like a child suddenly thrown into the wild. I knew that I could give up, because it wasn't forced to continue and learn. But also, that is why I can continue. Unlike the school subjects or the homework, When I was coding, I was free. I was able to learn and experiment with whatever I wanted&mdash;unless I broke the computer&mdash;and it gave me the valid, certain results,&mdash;sometimes, the answers for my homework,&mdash; not like the numbers written in the corner of the sheet, which was for the test about the subjects that we didn't know when to use. That's why I could continue even without enough resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the references well enough, held them in one hand, and sometimes, followed my instinct. Learning programming was not easy for a 12-year-old boy, especially at that time without any guidance. But there was something I wanted to create, and when it formed the shape, it was so exciting! I could get something special that most of my friends could not get at that time. That's why I continued learning, I WANTED to learn.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, I didn't learn. It was a joy for me to create something with my hands by coding. That's why I could learn coding without learning. I was just creating useful tools. I just "played" with coding.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's how I learned programming. No internet information, no AI, and no teacher. But also no class I must attend, no fancy pointless memorizations, and no test without meaning. Cut through the jungle by myself, walked across the plain, heading wherever I wanted to go, and built my palace on top of the hill.
