# :pager:Legacy vs Modern:computer:

I dig into depth of programming legacy - as a **Digital Archaeologist**.

## :seedling: Overview

### The Definition of "Legacy"

- In this repository, "*Legacy*" means literally "**legacy**."
- Which means:
  - It doesn't just mean "*outdated, uneditable code*" or "*ruins*."
  - But the old and *forgotten code*.
  - The code that *still exists **beneath*** the modern code.
  - The base structural code (mostly machine code or something close to it) that ***structures** modern abstracted code*.

Legacy code isn't just *history*, it's the hidden structure that made the present *possible*.

### Preservation of the "Legacy"

This repository exists to bridge generations of programming, not to forget what our ancestors have created, and remind us *how far we've come*, like a history museum of programming.

## :thinking: Why Legacy Matters

Most of us don't see those "legacies" when we create a new system with modern code. However, that will *always* be there beneath our code to make it *work* as we programmed.

Every library, every framework, every abstract one-liner sits on top of code that someone once wrote by *their very hands*, byte by byte, line by line...

It's like using a radio. We don't care how it works, but when we turn on the switch, it plays the sound, we turn the dial, and it tunes.  
But all the *circuit* and all the *small parts* are **essential** for those functions. Even if there is a great system in it, it won't work **without them**.

And if you deeply respect what's beneath your code, your creation will become more than functional - it will carry trust and intention.

***Legacy is not what we leave behind - it's what we stand on.***
